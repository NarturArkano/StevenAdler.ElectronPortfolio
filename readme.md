Unfinished aspect:
Twitter feed is unimplemented.  Unfortunately when starting this project I knew nothing at all about any of the three languages involved (Node.js, ElectronJS, VueJS) and after implementing the other aspects of the program I didn't have time to understand the VueJS aspect required to implement the Twitter feeds. I imagine it would be done in a similar fashion to https://github.com/paupaulaz/VueJSTwitterFeed.
